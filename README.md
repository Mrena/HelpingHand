# HelpingHand
he main purpose of the application is for any family members to be able to locate their clan house and see what sort of help from that home for when they are needy, and for more fortunate family members to be able to show what sort of help they can give to needy clan members. Any family house hold which wish to offer help can use the app to plot on the map the current location of their house, what sort of help they can offer, e.g accommodation for a night, whether someone needing help should call first, who to call. They can even specify whether help is available for a specific day or not. Another thing which we will do is open a bank account where family members can donate small amounts of money for when a specific family house hold is in need of financial injection. This will require family members which handle money, and every single one of them will be required to transfer an agreed upon amount to a family in need. What will happen on the app is that a family in need will be post a description of their current situation they are in, what led to it, and what they need to ease up the situation a bit, and then every other member can vote based on the available funds and situation, which house hold to help, if they are more than one, and what amount to transfer.
